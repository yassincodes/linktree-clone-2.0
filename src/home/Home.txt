// things I don't understand in linktree
// the layout will break down at width 800px
// they are pretty slow

// how I made the linktree clone in just one day!
// I had this code, that I use for setting up authentication
// and linktree each authenticating user to firebase database
// what ealse you need?
// you'll just code the admin page
// and whenever a user changes something there
// you'll store it on firebase
// each use has his own array of data
// this array is organised by number
// number 0 => contains the basic info that I get from google auth
// number 1 => contains his customisation of the page
// number 2 to infinity => contains the links of the user and their properties

// try as hard as you can so that you can send an invite to sabra

// yakha na bach marbout ? ijam3a bach rabtitni ? ichhada kifah na marbout biha ?
// najm min 8odwa b9arar bark nasb7 fi dubai

// to fix
// if a user changes things in localStorage
// if there is no link, the background will be cutted
// if localStorage contains or things like that it won't work

// change the name of the copied className to an other name of your own
